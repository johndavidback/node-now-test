Okay, thanks, Abe. Anyway, this is a simple chat program based on the example
provided by nowjs and embellished by myself and the venerable [Brian Hicks](https://github.com/BrianHicks "Brian Hicks").

How does I do it?
-----------------

You need to have node installed.

After you pull this repo you need to install nowjs,

    npm install now

You can also use the package.json but I don't know how.

I'm tired of writing this.
