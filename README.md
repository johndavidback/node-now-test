Okay, thanks, Abe. Anyway, this is a simple chat program based on the example
provided by nowjs and embellished by myself and the venerable [Brian Hicks](https://github.com/BrianHicks "Brian Hicks").

How does I do it?
-----------------

You need to have node installed. To do that, simply go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/ "Makes sense, don't it?") and download the package installer for whatever OS you have.

After you pull this repo you need to install nowjs,

    npm install now

You can also just use the package.json thing by doing
    
    npm install

I'm tired of writing this.
